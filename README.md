# Web Development Course by Development Island

Following along with "The Complete Web Development Course" by Development Island on Udemy, I will save each exercise or section as a different file in the appropriate folder.

## HTML

  This section covers headings, images, inline vs block elements, lists, tables, forms.
marketplaceCheckout.html is a sample checkout form created only using HTML with entry forms for address, a drop down for shipping method, radio buttons for payment method, and check boxes to choose whether to sign up for email updates. 

## CSS

  This section covers Cascading Style Sheets to change font, alignment, background, with some transforms and transitions and notes on browser compatibilty. Emphasis on the box model of padding, border, outline, and margin helped to solidify CSS alignment concepts. 

## JavaScript

  This section covers JavaScript to change HTML style and content, objects, arrays, loops, errors, setInterval and setTimeout, and cookies. Activities during this section included a simple while loop for spending money, a password validation using regular expressions, and a random color generator. The section was concluded with the Math Game project.

## jQuery

  How to use the jQuery library to manipulate HTML and CSS elements, along with AJAX to change only part of the page, and jQuery effects to create visual effects and animations. Introduction to jQuery UI for both themes and specific effects to make the page more user interactive. This section was concluded with a fruit slice game project.
  
## Bootstrap
  Introduction to responsive design with Twitter Bootstrap. Topics covered included the Bootstrap CSS grid system, forms, tables, navbars, jumbotrons, dropdown menus, and buttons. This section was concluded with five projects.

## Websites

### Math Tutorials Website:
  Created using HTML and CSS, this website serves as a mockup of a front end web site focused on providing math tutorials to students grade one through twelve. It contains a header with a search box, a menu for accessing different areas of the site, a brief introduction followed by two columns with a list of links to each year of lessons and a list of features of the site, followed by a footer with an example copyright section. All links are blank as this site was simply made as an example page. Hosted at http://willmcintosh.thecompletewebhosting.com/Websites/Math_Tutorials/

### Math Game Website:
  Created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this website is a simple 0 to 12's multiplication table game where the user gets points for clicking the correct answer out of four for 60 seconds. I followed the tutorials for the HTML and CSS portions, and was able to pause the video and do the JavaScript on my own. I then watched the videos and compared methods. I had onclick events in my HTML file, which I removed and did in the JavaScript instead after uploading my code to Codepen and having it check my HTML. I also added additional browser compatibilty from tips on Codepen for radial and linear gradients. I didn't know that -webkit-etc need to go before the standard formatting in CSS.

### Fruit Slice Game:
  Created using HTML, CSS, jQuery, and jQueryUI, this is a fruit slice game with fruit that explodes and makes a sound on mouseover. Using HTML and jQuery, it will make a slicing sound on mouse over, and using jQuery and jQuery UI, the fruit does an explode animation. Each new fruit is shown/hidden with timing events.
  
### App Landing Page:
  Created using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. A responsive sample page for a mobile travel app. Used a background image in a jumbotron from [FreeNatureStock](http://freenaturestock.com/) and an airplane logo from [logomakr](https://logomakr.com/). Using media queries, the page will resize for different device sizes.

### Company Website
  After commenting in the instructions, I paused the video and pulled up the finished file from the class files in a separate Chrome tab and did my best to mimic it using what I had learned in class. I would occasionally have to peek at the styling using Chrome developer tools to learn things like the background image styling using `background-attachment: fixed` and `background-size: cover`. When I had created the site, I watched the videos on fast forward and made some adjustments to the style so that it matched the example site perfectly.
