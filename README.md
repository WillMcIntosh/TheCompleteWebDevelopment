# Web Development Course by Development Island

Following along with "The Complete Web Development Course" by Development Island on Udemy, I will save each exercise or section as a different file in the appropriate folder.

## HTML

This section covers headings, images, inline vs block elements, lists, tables, forms.

marketplaceCheckout.html is a sample checkout form created only using HTML with entry forms for address, a drop down for shipping method, radio buttons for payment method, and check boxes to choose whether to sign up for email updates. 

## CSS

This section covers Cascading Style Sheets to change font, alignment, background, with some transforms and transitions and notes on browser compatibilty. Emphasis on the box model of padding, border, outline, and margin helped to solidify CSS alignment concepts.

## Websites

###Math Tutorials Website:
  Created using HTML and CSS, this website serves as a mockup of a front end web site focused on providing math tutorials to students grade one through twelve. It contains a header with a search box, a menu for accessing different areas of the site, a brief introduction followed by two columns with a list of links to each year of lessons and a list of features of the site, followed by a footer with an example copyright section. All links are blank as this site was simply made as an example page. Hosted at http://willmcintosh.thecompletewebhosting.com/Websites/Math_Tutorials/
